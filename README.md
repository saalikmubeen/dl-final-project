## Environment Setup

We use a Python virtual environment (`venv`) to ensure consistent dependencies and reproducible experiments.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ installed ([Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- Git installed ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
- `pip` package manager (comes with Python 3+)

### Initial Setup Instructions

Clone the repository and run the setup script to create and configure the environment:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:saalikmubeen/dl-final-project.git
cd dl-final-project
./setup.sh
```

### Activate the Virtual Environment

After running the setup script, activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Jupyter Notebook Usage

To use Jupyter Notebooks, ensure the virtual environment is activated and run:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### Deactivate the Virtual Environment

When done, you can deactivate the virtual environment with:

```bash
deactivate
```
